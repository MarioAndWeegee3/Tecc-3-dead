# Tecc 3
A kitchen sink pack for Fabric

## Install Directions:

1. Create a Fabric Loader instance in whatever launcher you want. This pack is for Minecraft 1.14.4, and Fabric 0.6.1
2. Move the Contents of the Config, ResourcePack and DataPack folders to the correct folders
3. Download the mods from Curseforge. _Optifine is not on Curseforge. Get it from Optifine.net._
4. Enable the Resource Pack if you want. It makes the Chunk Activator look like the Chunk Loader from Dimensional Anchors, and matches the new recipe better.
